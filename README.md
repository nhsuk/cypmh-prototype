# NHS.UK prototype kit


This is a prototype for NHS CYPMHS

<!-- Visit the <a href="http://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs">NHS.UK prototype kit site</a> to download the latest version and read the documentation.




## Security

 If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a <a href="http://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs/how-tos/heroku">username and password</a>. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like NHS.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
