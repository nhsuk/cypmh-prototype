    <p><b>The first step to getting support from NHS mental health services is usually getting a referral from a professional such as a GP, teacher or social worker. </b></p>
    <p><b>The referral will give your details to a specialist service that can offer you help, support and treatment.</b></p>
    <p><b>For some services you may also be able to refer yourself - or your parent or carer can refer you.</b></p>

                    <h2>What to do if you’re having difficulty accessing professional support</h2>
                      <p>If you can’t get a referral from your GP, you could try asking a different GP or finding out who else can refer you. It may be useful to know <a href="javascript: void(0)" title="">how GPs decide when to refer someone to children and young people’s mental health services</a>.</p>
                      <p>If you’ve had an initial assessment but have been told that you will not get any treatment or support on the NHS, this can feel disappointing and frustrating.</p>
                      <p>If a particular service wasn’t able to help, you can try looking for another service that can.</p>
                      <p>Go back to the person who referred you and ask them what other options there are. It will help if you can tell them why the service said they can’t help you.</p>
                      <p>You can also do your own research into other services. There is a <a href=\"https://www.annafreud.org/on-my-mind/youth-wellbeing/\">youth wellbeing directory</a> on the Anna Freud charity website.</p>
                      <p>If you still cannot get a referral, then there are people who may be able to speak up for you or give you advice. This is called advocacy or being an advocate.</p>
                      <p>You can find out more about advocacy from:</p>
